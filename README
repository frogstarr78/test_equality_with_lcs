= test_equality_with_lcs

Compare two strings, or arrays, and get failed results back in an easy to distinguish LCS output.

Let's say you want to test two strings:
@string1 = "Hello World!"
@string2 = "Hello Bob!"

*Unit tests*:
class ClassName < Test::Unit::TestCase
  include TestWithLCS::Unit

  def test_something
	assert_equal_with_lcs @string1, @string2
  end
end

and 

*Spec tests*:
define "Something" do
  include TestWithLCS::Spec

  it "matches" do
    @string1.should be_equal_with_lcs(@string2)
  end
end

result in the output:
      ! !   
Hello World!
Hello Bob  !

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
