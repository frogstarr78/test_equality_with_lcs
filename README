= test_equality_with_lcs

Compare two strings, or arrays, and get failed results back in an easy to distinguish LCS output.

Let's say you want to test two strings:
@string1 = "Hello World!"
@string2 = "Hello Bob!"

*Unit tests*:
class ClassName < Test::Unit::TestCase
  include TestWithLCS::Unit

  def test_something
	assert_equal_with_lcs @string1, @string2
  end
end

and 

*Spec tests*:
define "Something" do
  include TestEqualityWithLCS::Spec

  it "matches" do
    @string1.should be_equal_with_lcs(@string2)
  end
end

result in the output:

'      ! !   '
'Hello World!'
'Hello Bob  !'

* without the quotes though. 
  I added them to bring attention
  to the included whitespace.
